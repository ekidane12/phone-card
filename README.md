# Phone Card App
#First Odin Project. 

## Languages Used 
1. HTML 
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

## Description
In this project I built several functionalities to the app. Each functionality unique from the other and each testing different parts of programming. 

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project was to put into practice what I have learned so far. Adding functionalities on the front end side of a web app. 

## Reflection
- I found it to be harder but rewarding to apply knowledge than learning it theoretically. 
- I am now much more confident in being able to make JS work with HTML to achieve desired outcome.  
- I learned there is still a lot more to be learned
